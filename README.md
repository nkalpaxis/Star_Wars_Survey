# Star Wars Survey

In this project we're going to be analyzing data on the Star Wars movies. FiveThirtyEight is a website that focuses on opinion poll analysis and before Star Wars: The Force Awakens released the team was interesting in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. They collected data using the online tool SurveyMonkey which generated 835 total responses, we'll be analyzing this data throughout the project.
